Here’s a summarized version in English:

I want you to create a crypto bot that trades XRP futures on the 30-minute chart using my Bybit API.

**Bot Features:**

- The bot should work with a futures account and use the API for all actions.
- **Trading Actions:**
  - Open long positions.
  - Open short positions.
  - All positions should be opened using market orders, not limit orders.
  
- **Grid Trading Strategy:**
  - A configurable grid (default 150) between the price range of 0.4 to 0.8.
  - The bot should open a position each time the price touches the grid, regardless of how many positions are already open.

- **Bot Settings:**
  - Start trading at the current price when the bot launches.
  - Option to configure the bot for long or short trading.
  - Positions should only be closed when they are profitable.
  - Option to reserve a percentage of the balance (e.g., reserve 50% and use the other 50% for trading).

- **Position Management:**
  - For each position, the bot checks the current USDT balance via the API, divides it by the grid size, and allocates that amount for each position.
  - This process is repeated for each new position.

- **Leverage:**
  - The bot should use futures trading with adjustable leverage (default 10x).

- **Console Output:**
  - Display the balance in USDT.
  - Show the debt and profit, updating every minute.
  - Track and display the profit made after closing positions.
  - Include a hotkey combination to close the bot.

- **End of Session Report:**
  - When the bot is closed, it should display:
    - The initial balance.
    - The profit made.
    - The number of open positions and the debt in those positions.
    - The remaining balance after closing all positions and the final amount in dollars.
    - The percentage profit made from the initial balance.

- **Logging:**
  - Log every trade in a text file.
  - If a file already exists, create a new one with an incremented name.
  - On bot closure, log the final balance, the initial balance, and the percentage profit made.
  - Implement a zero-division check when calculating percentage gain.

- **Testing:**
  - Provide test code to verify the bot’s functionality using historical data for XRP on the 30-minute timeframe through the Bybit API.
