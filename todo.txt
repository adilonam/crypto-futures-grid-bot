I want you to write a crypto bot for me that will trade futures 
xrp coins on a 30-minute chart via a personal bybit API 
that uses the API for all actions, 
I need a bot that works with a futures account 
to use the API to open buy positions (long), to use it to open a sell position (short), 
the grid must be configured by default 150 from the price from 0.4 to 0.8.
 Start and wait for movement on the grid to open positions is available, 
since with each touch of positions it creates a position, and it does not matter how many positions Opening 
a position only on the market with and no limit 
when starting the bot to bot trade at the current price, 
make it possible to configure a working bot for short or for long a position, 
it should close all positions if its have positive pnl !!!! 

It is important to make an option not to touch the current balance percentage. 
this means that 50 percent is allowed, which he saved and 50 used for each trade for the position, 

which then the current balance of USDT via API
 divides the balance by the number of grids and as much money as he chooses for 1 position, 
and at the next position, which then the current balance via API and divides it by the amount grids and the amount of money offered for 1 position, 
and repeats so before to open all positions, 

how to open each position, uses Futures trading and a default adjustable leverage of 10x, 

made it so that I could see what it was doing bot right now in the console, 

to set the balance: only in usdt, which is on the account 
 and to write how much I owe and how much I always won and updated every minute always 
 wrote how much he earned after closing trades calculate how many benefits 
 and wrote how much it was necessary to count 

make the keys to close the bot 

at the end when closing made it so that it wrote how much money was initially then profit 
how much the bot made and calculate how many positions are still open 
and how much in positions I owe calculate and write these dollars 
I will owe in open positions and calculate the balance after it closes all positions 
and write how much it is in dollars a
nd at the end of the percentage how much of the starting balance is done 

made so that it wrote each trade in a text file, 
if the file already exists, then a new one and add 1 to the name 

when closing bot in the trade file wrote how much balance at the end and 
how much money was and 
show much percent he spent Checking division by zero: Added a check for zero when calculating the Winning percentage. This is a special division by zero if the initial balance is equal.

make a test code on this bot to check that everything works for the last year on xrp coins on a 30-minute timeframe through the personal API bybit
